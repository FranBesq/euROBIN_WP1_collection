# euROBIN_WP1_collection

This is a repository to collect the contributions from the euROBIN WP1 Partners. This is only an intial collection and we can organize the contents after we have received them. 

As a goal, submissions to this repository can be downloaded and run by the partners to test on their physical robot platform and evaluated on their task board.

Please feel free to make pull requests to this repository for contributing modular robot skill solutions to the task board. 

Open Items:
- Format and Structure for this repository (description of partner robot platforms)
- Develop a simulated environment for evaluating the contributed solutions 
- Decide for a common Robot Action Planner to ask across the partner robot platforms
